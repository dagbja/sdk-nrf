#     [zephyr]
#     base = zephyr

manifest:
  # This west.yml requires west 0.7 or later, because the "import"
  # feature used below was introduced then.
  version: 0.7

  # Import projects from the sdk-nrf West manifest.
  # The sdk-nrf West manifest dictates the modules and dependencies
  # versions to import. They can be updated if needed:
  # * Whitelist/blacklist can be used to import modules or not.
  # * Versions/SHA can be overridden here or in separated files.
  projects:

    # Source West manifest. Modules are imported from there.
